# IMDB-Top-250-Movies-Project

As a 90's child, I remember having a lot of fun watching movies with my family. 
My big brother didn't allow me to watch with subtitles, and as a result, I had to rely on my English skills to understand the dialogue. 
This experience helped me develop my language skills, and I have been interested in movies ever since.

For this project, I used Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and pandas to analyze a database of movies. 
My main goal was to explore the connections within this database and gain insights into trends in the movie industry. 
By examining data such as box office earnings, ratings, and genres, I was able to identify patterns and draw conclusions about the movies industry.

Through this project, I hope to provide valuable insights into the movie industry and inspire others to explore data analysis as a tool for understanding the world around us.
