After i uploaded my Database i exanimed it and selected a subset of columns with the relevant data for the analysis.

I converted the non-num other columns into numeric data types while ignoring any non-numeric value.The non-numeric are converted to NaN.
(I also rounded a bit the values for a  easier display)

My first Question was- How many movies were debuted in the last 50 years? (1972-2022)
